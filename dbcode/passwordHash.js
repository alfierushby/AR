// to do: add exception handling to both functions



//uses a random salt
//need to figure out how to verify it then, but it is very secure as hashes generated are 
//always different -> cant reverse lookup in a common hash table

// hashes the password 2^10 times -> makes bruteforcing difficult and slow for hackers
// needs to be slow enough for brute forcing to be difficult, but not too slow so user interaction isnt slow
// around 10 is a good number(around 100ms time taken)
